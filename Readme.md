# Purpose

This is a simple app to mute your speakers for a specific amount of time. Adjust this line `Thread.Sleep(60000);` to change the time. The time is in milliseconds.

This runs on Windows.

## Reason

I often stop or mute music when someone visits me or mute during an annoying & very loud commercial. I tend to forget to unmute the music. This solves that.
